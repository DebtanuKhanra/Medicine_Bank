ADO.NET is a set of classes that expose data access services for .NET Framework programmers. ADO.NET provides a rich set of components for creating distributed, data-sharing applications. It is an integral part of the .NET Framework, providing access to relational, XML, and application data. ADO.NET supports a variety of development needs, including the creation of front-end database clients and middle-tier business objects used by applications, tools, languages, or Internet browsers.ADO.NET provides a bridge between the front end controls and the back end database. The ADO.NET objects encapsulate all the data access operations and the controls interact with these objects to display data, thus hiding the details of movement of data.

‚óè For UI design, we used Figma. <br>
‚óè We used all Ado.Net classes, including:
Connection Class.<br>
Command Class.<br>
DataReader Class.<br>
DataAdapter Class.<br>
And DataSet.Class which is the heart of the Ado.Net. <br>
‚óè Two databases were created. One for keeping employee records, including user IDs, names, passwords, and email addresses, and one more for keeping the medicines.<br>
‚óè The sign-up and log-in pages were created for security reasons.<br>
‚óè If an owner or employee forgets their password, they can reset it with ease.<br>
‚óè Increase the quantity of such drugs right away if the employee desires to add additional of them.<br>
‚óè And all they need to do to add new drugs to their record is enter the name, quantity, and cost of the new drug. And the new medicine will be added to the database automatically.<br>
‚óè This initiative makes it much easier for chemists & Druggist staff members or owners to quickly find medicines that are kept in the store.<br>
‚óè An employee can go directly to the billing department and create an Invoice for any drugs they discover that are stored in their database, just enter the name and quantity of that medicine, and the invoice will be produced automatically.<br>
